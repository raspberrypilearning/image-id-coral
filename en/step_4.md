## Retrain a model with a script.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
You can also retrain an existing model using a Python script, that will run using your locally stored directories of images.
</div>
<div>
![](images/image.png){:width="300px"}
</div>
</div>

To retrain a model on your computer you will need to have your Coral TPU connected, your image directories, and a pre-trained model.
