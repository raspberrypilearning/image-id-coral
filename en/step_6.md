[Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/) is part of the European Astro Pi Challenge, an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation for young people aged 19 and under in [ESA Member States](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/eligibility), Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Canada.

In Mission Space Lab teams are invited to write computer programs that solve a scientific task in space: to gather data to calculate the speed at which the International Space Station (ISS) is travelling as accurately as possible. To achieve this, teams write a Python program to first use the Astro Pi computersâ€™ sensors or camera and gather data about the orientation and motion of the ISS as it orbits the Earth, and then calculate the speed of the ISS based on the gathered data.

Each Astro Pi unit will have a Coral Machine Learning Accelerator attached to it.

If you would like to enter Mission Space Lab, you might like to experiment with the [day, night, twilight](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1owb4zoZzSMld5qX0edCwZ1qZ6ypnJQ_5?usp=sharing) images provided.

There are other ways you could use the Coral and Machine Learning for your Mission Space Lab programs though. With image recognition, you might like to try and experiment with detecting ocean, land, or coastlines. You could look for mountain ranges, lakes, or deserts.

If you want to learn more about using Coral, have a look through the examples and documentation at [https://coral.ai](https://coral.ai).
