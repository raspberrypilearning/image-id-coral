[Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab/) is a competition run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation for European Space Agency member countries and Canada. The competition involves writing code for one of the two Astro Pi units on the ISS. Each Astro Pi unit will have a Google Coral unit attached to it.

If you would like to enter the Mission Space Lab competition, you might like to experiment with the [day, night, twilight](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1owb4zoZzSMld5qX0edCwZ1qZ6ypnJQ_5?usp=sharing) images provided.

There are other ways you could use the Coral and Machine Learning for your Mission Space Lab project though. With image recognition, you might like to try and experiment with detecting ocean, land, or coastlines. You could look for mountain ranges, lakes, or deserts.

With Machine Learning, you could also look at other data sources. You could analyse and then predict temperature changes on the ISS, or look into predicting orbital corrections.

If you want to learn more about using Coral, have a look through the examples and documentation at [https://coral.ai](https://coral.ai).
